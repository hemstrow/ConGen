Introductions. 

Introduction to R
	Programming languages:
		5 minute excercise -- write instructions to an alien for making a piece of buttered toast.
			Assume alien knows what things are (knife, bread, a toaster), but doesn't know how they work.
	R vs R studio:
		R is a piece of music, Rstudio is your iPod/phone.

Objects, classes, access, and vectorized operations.
	Basic math and numbers
	characters
	Assignment
	Vectors and c() and ":"
		 numeric and character
	Vector access with brackets
		Access by INDEX, not identity! Assign four volunteers to indices and give them numbers to shout when called.
		numbers
		c()
		negative indices
	Vector math and recycling
	Logical and factors
	matrices
		access by row and column
	data.frames (use mtcars)
		access by column name "$" or c()
		vector math redux
	lists

File Structures and Reading Data
	Diagram out a file scructure
		Absolute and relative paths
	Reading data with R
		With the import data tool in Rstudio
			Example: have students download the monarch_example.txt file. Import first with the import tool, note the filepath, then using read.table.
				Note: tab completion
		With read.table

Subsetting
	Subsetting by logical vectors
	Logical operators
	Subsetting via logical operators
		Start by just grabbing the Days_to_Pupation column of mon
		Make a logical vector for Treatment == Constant
		Subset Days_to_pupation by treatment
		Combine into one call, rows and columns
	OR, AND, !, and %in%
		%in%: use iris$Species

Functions
	Anatomy of a function (arguments)
	What is a function under-the-hood
	? and help()
	How to google
		Include "R"
		How to find the function for what you want to do.
		
Rmarkdown
	What is RMD
	Basic text formatting
		Headers
		lists
	Chunks
		making chunks
		running chunks
		
Git
	What is a github repo
		Version control
		Utility -- why do we care
			Great for organization
			Great for collaboration
	Making a new github repo
		Log on to github, make and copy an access token.
			Settings -> Developer settings (at the bottom) -> Personal access tokens -> Generate token
				for now, copy and paste this somewhere
		make a new empty repo
		Clone the repo, make new R project from version control
	Working with git
		Add, commit, push, and pull with Rstudio
			Terminal:
				What is the terminal (access to command line linux)
				git config global --user.name "hemstrow"
				git config global --user.email "whemstrom@ucdavis.edu"
			Need your token to push!
				can save this with certificates package, not covered here.


Packages
	What are packages
	Installing packages: CRAN
		install remotes
	Library vs ::
	Installing packages: other sources
		remotes install snpR

Plotting with ggplot2
	About Layers (during snpR install)
		when to quote
		Adding layers
			point plus smooth (lm)
	
	Use the monarch data:
		Body_Mass vs Marea, with Treatment as color
		
	Vs base plot()

Writing functions
	No function for sample standard error, write one (sd/sqrt(n))
		Run on several columns of mon
	Var function exists, but write one too:
		sum(x - mean(x))/n
		Oops! This is a sample, not the population! Need to use n - 1:
			Only need to change in one place!

Collaboration with github
	Adding people to repos
	merge errors
		fix errors, delete merge head, commit and push

snpR intro
	Facets in snpR
	Object access:
		stats
		genotypes
		metadata
		subsetting
